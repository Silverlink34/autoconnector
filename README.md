Disclaimer:I do not own AutoHotkey, Putty, 7Zip. Filezilla, RDP+, MailSend, or any other programs this script calls upon.
I am simply the author of the script.
I am also not responsible for any damage to your computer, you are the user that decided to trust my program.
If you bought this script/exe somewhere, you have been scammed and did not receive it from me, as my work is open source and anyone can view/change it to their own liking.
